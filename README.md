# UnityProject
This is a game I began developing during the Summer 2018. I spent time learning how a lot of the basics of Unity work and getting comfortable with it all. 

The game is very much in the early stages. I decided that a fun gameplay to build around was naturally explosions. I also wanted to build something that I could play quickly with a friend, perhaps as a way to settle a score (an alternative to flipping a coin or rock-paper-scissors).

The idea is to have two players, each of which build a structure to protect a golden egg. Before seeing the opponents structure you would have a budget to spend among a variety of weapons. After picking which weapons to bring, you are presented with the opponents base and do the best that you can to destroy it and to reach the golden egg. Whoever does the better job wins the round.

At the moment I have created a build mode and an attack mode for a single character. 
In build they may fly and place/destroy blocks in various sized walls.
  --To be improved: Different types of blocks to use.
In attack they have the option to attack with either grenades or slow moving explosive blocks. 
  --To be improved: A larger array of weapon choices.
 
Overall I need to implement the multiplayer and actually put together the structure of the game. Right now it is a sandbox game. Additionally I plan on devising some interesting way of scoring the destruction accomplished in each round.
